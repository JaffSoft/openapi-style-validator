## Important
Please consider this project as "in development".
It should be ready in a couple of weeks.

## The concept

Unless you are working alone on a small API, you are probably working with other people on your yaml file. 
Even if you write your standards on a PDF or on a wiki somewhere and send it to all the team members, there is no
garanty they will follow it.

You could argue that you will do code review to prevent these errors. Yes you could but what if you
could automatize all of this? You could still do code review to find business/requirements/rest path error
but let the tools validate for style and standards like example, naming conventions, description, etc...

## Alternatives

This project was started because when I tried SwaggerHub (which is the paid version of the swagger toolkit), they had
this exact same tool, but it was proprietary. I didn't want to pay for the service
so I created this project in my free times.
